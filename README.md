## Credit-card-fraud-detection
The notebook contains Machine Learning models to detect credit card transaction fraud.


# Dataset
The dataset was retrieved from an open-source website, Kaggle.com.
It contains data on transactions made in 2013 by European credit card users in two days only. 
Thedataset consists of 31 attributes and 284,808 rows. 
Twenty-eight attributes are numeric variables that, due to the confidentiality and privacy of the customers, have been transformed using PCA transformation; the three remaining attributes are ”Time”, 
which contains the elapsed seconds between the first and other transactions of each Attribute, ”Amount” is the amount of each transaction, and the final attribute “Class” 
which contains binary variableswhere “1” is a case of fraudulent transaction, and “0” is not as case of fraudulent transaction.
